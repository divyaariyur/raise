                    <h2>What Are Invisible Disabilities?</h2>
                    <br/ >
                    <p>When we think of disabilities, we often picture physical impairments that are visible to the eye. However, many disabilities exist beyond what we can immediately see—these are known as invisible disabilities. From chronic illnesses and mental health conditions to autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, these hidden challenges affect millions of lives daily. Unlike visible physical disabilities, invisible disabilities often go unnoticed, leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions. Individuals living with these conditions may face significant challenges that are not obvious to others, making it harder to receive the understanding and support they need.

                    <h2>Need to raise awareness</h2>
                    <br/ >
                    <p>Invisible disabilities are often overlooked because they lack physical markers that are visible to the eye. This lack of visibility creates significant challenges for individuals living with these conditions, making it difficult for them to receive the understanding and support they need. Despite their hidden nature, these disabilities can profoundly impact an individual’s daily life, emotional well-being and overall functioning.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Raising awareness about invisible disabilities can indeed open doors to better communication and understanding. When people are more informed about conditions that aren't immediately visible, such as mental health disorders, learning disabilities, or chronic illnesses, it encourages empath, reduces stigma, and fosters more inclusive environments. This awareness opens the door for open conversations, helping to create supportive spaces in schools communities where individuals with invisible disabilities feel heard and supported.</p>
