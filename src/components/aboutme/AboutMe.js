                    <br />
                    <p>I am Divya Ariyur, the founder of RAISE, an educational initiative dedicated to fostering a more empathetic and understanding environment for young people dealing with health challenges that are not immediately visible to others.</p> 
                    <br />
                    <p>Invisible disabilities—such as mental health conditions, chronic illnesses, neurological disorders, and learning disabilities—can profoundly impact daily life, yet they often go unnoticed. Through RAISE, I hope to bridge the gap between awareness and understanding by providing students and community members with practical tips to better support individuals facing these hidden challenges.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I strongly believe awareness is the first step toward building a more inclusive world where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued.</p>
